# ChessBoard-Lab2

I have made 2 differing files,

Chessboard - program
  Holds the Non extra segments of the lab, it hold Unicode printing symbols so they are more compact.
  
  
Chessboard - programExtra
  This file holds the normal program + the extra sections of the assignment, it has swapped to the provided symbols.
  there's a limitation to place the piece at 26 squares, due to not having a board that can go over 'z' in the alphabet
